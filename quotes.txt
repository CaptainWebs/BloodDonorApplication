Blood Donation will cost you nothing but it will save a life!
If you’re a blood donor, you’re a hero to someone, somewhere, who received your gracious gift of life.
The finest gesture one can make is to save life by donating Blood.
Tears of a mother cannot save her Child. But your Blood can.
The Blood Donor of today may be recipient of tomorrow.
To the young and healthy it’s no loss. To sick it’s hope of life. Donate Blood to give back life.
